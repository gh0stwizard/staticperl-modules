NAME

Params::Classify - argument type classification

DESCRIPTION

This module provides various type-testing functions.  These are intended
for functions that, unlike most Perl code, care what type of data they
are operating on.  For example, some functions wish to behave differently
depending on the type of their arguments (like overloaded functions
in C++).

There are two flavours of function in this module.  Functions of the first
flavour only provide type classification, to allow code to discriminate
between argument types.  Functions of the second flavour package up the
most common type of type discrimination: checking that an argument is
of an expected type.  The functions come in matched pairs, of the two
flavours, and so the type enforcement functions handle only the simplest
requirements for arguments of the types handled by the classification
functions.  Enforcement of more complex types may, of course, be built
using the classification functions, or it may be more convenient to use
a module designed for the more complex job, such as L<Params::Validate>.

This module is implemented in XS, with a pure Perl backup version for
systems that can't handle XS.
