version 0.007; 2012-02-11

  * be thread-safe, by mutex control on op check hooking

  * in pure Perl implementation, avoid putting extra eval stack frames
    around the require, to avoid unnecessary complication of exception
    handling; this can't be done on Perls 5.9.4 to 5.10.0, so don't
    allow use of the pure Perl implementation on those Perls

  * revise documentation to suggest loading this module earlier

  * document the relevant changes to the Perl core in more detail

  * on Perl versions where the pure Perl implementation can't work,
    dynamically declare requirement for XS infrastructure in Build.PL

  * refine threshold for ability to correctly override require from
    5.8.0 to 5.7.2

  * revise minimum required Perl version down from 5.6.1 to 5.6.0

  * test that modules see the correct context at file scope

  * test that module return values are handled correctly

  * test that the module doesn't generate warnings

  * in pure Perl implementation, fix handling of the variable that
    previously needed to be "our"

  * rearrange and better comment the treatment of lexical warnings in
    the Perl code

version 0.006; 2011-11-20

  * bugfix: avoid loading warnings.pm and leaving its delayed requires
    of Carp.pm susceptible to hint leakage, which was causing trouble
    on some Perls

  * skip swash test on Perl 5.6, where swash loading appears to be broken
    by loading Test::More or anything else useful

  * remove bogus tests that cause false failures on Perl 5.15.5

  * in Build.PL, declare incompatibility with pre-0.19
    B::Hooks::OP::Check, which doesn't play nicely around op check hooking

  * comment why a variable surprisingly needs to be "our"

  * convert .cvsignore to .gitignore

version 0.005; 2011-07-25

  * bugfix: work around core bug [perl #73174] affecting Unicode swash
    loading, and apply entire workaround arrangement to 5.11.{0..5}
    where [perl #73174] exists but [perl #68590] does not

  * correct dynamic_config setting to 0

  * include META.json in distribution

  * add MYMETA.json to .cvsignore

version 0.004; 2010-11-21

  * bugfix: don't attempt to use XS version of the workaround on Win32,
    where it can't work properly due to linker restriction on access to
    core symbols

  * only define PERL_CORE for compilation on Perl versions where the
    bug workaround (and thus interference with core-private stuff)
    is actually necessary

  * in XS, use PERL_NO_GET_CONTEXT for efficiency

  * in XS, declare "PROTOTYPES: DISABLE" to prevent automatic generation
    of unintended prototypes

  * in XS, provide a reserve definition of croak, so that the Perl_croak
    circumlocution is avoided even with PERL_CORE defined

  * in XS, give symbolic names to the Perl version thresholds

  * jump through hoops to avoid compiler warnings

  * use full stricture in test suite

  * also test POD coverage of pure Perl implementation

  * in t/setup_pp.pl, avoid a warning that occurs if XSLoader::load()
    is given no arguments, which is now a valid usage

  * in Build.PL, explicitly set needs_compiler to avoid bogus
    auto-dependency on ExtUtils::CBuilder

  * in Build.PL, complete declaration of configure-time requirements

version 0.003; 2010-04-10

  * bugfix: in pure-Perl implementation, make sure ambient package (from
    which require is invoked) is passed on correctly to the code in the
    required file, on those Perls where it is so inherited

  * in XS, use macros to avoid explicit passing of aTHX, in the manner
    of the core

  * in XS, avoid using "class" as a variable name, for compatibility
    with C++ compilers

  * make all numeric comparisons against $] stringify it first, to avoid
    architecture-dependent problems with floating point rounding giving
    it an unexpected numeric value

  * in Build.PL, explicitly declare configure-time requirements

  * add MYMETA.yml to .cvsignore

version 0.002; 2009-10-21

  * generate a more normal-looking op tree, that doesn't crash B::Deparse

  * don't apply the workaround on Perl 5.11.0 or later, where the bug
    has been fixed

  * in t/seal.t, test that cop_hints_hash is properly handled

  * check for required Perl version at runtime

version 0.001; 2009-09-26

  * bugfix: die cleanly if the pure-Perl implementation is needed but
    won't work (which occurs on pre-5.8 perls)

  * bugfix: avoid undesired warning from pure-Perl implementation if
    require has already been overridden via CORE::GLOBAL::require

  * in tests, set HINT_LOCALIZE_HH where appropriate, to avoid false
    test failures on pre-5.10 perls

  * test that the module plays nicely with code that overrides require
    via CORE::GLOBAL::require

version 0.000; 2009-09-22

  * initial released version
