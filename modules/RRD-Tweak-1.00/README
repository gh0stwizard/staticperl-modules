RRD-Tweak

This is a module for manipulating the structure of RRDtool files. It can
read a file, alter its DS and RRA structure, and save a new file. It
also allows creating new empty RRD files in memory or on the disk.

The file read/write operations are implemented in native C. The module
links with librrd, so the librrd library and its header files are
required for building the RRD::Tweak module. The module is tested with
RRDtool versions 1.3 and 1.4. As the RRD file format is architecture
dependent, RRD::Tweak can only read files which are created by RRDtool
in the same processor architecture.
